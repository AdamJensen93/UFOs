# UFOs
## Overview
Using various tools, we created a dynamic webpage that users could use to filter UFO sightings based on various information. Users are able to filter sightings based on date, city, state, country, and shape of the object.
### Resources
 - Data source: data.js provided (UFO sighting data)
 - Software: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Microsoft VisualStudio
## Results
I refactored the app.js and index.html to update the filter search box as well as provide more than one filter option for the user. A user can use as many filters as they desire to look for very specific events or they can use as little filters as they like to look at UFO sightings in a more generalized manner.
## Summary
This is an excellent demonstation of how Javascript can be used to provide users the ability to sort through large arrays quickly to find specific information. As the data.js grows with more sightings, there will be more information readiliy avaiable to the user. More work can be done in this area by determining if there are other factors users would like to use to filter as well as collecting and qualifying more data. I do think that there are some design issues that could be tightened up and corrected to make the display more visually appealing such as alligning the filter boxes to be even with one another rather than being flush with the text which varries in length.
